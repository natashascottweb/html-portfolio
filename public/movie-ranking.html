<h1>The Best Movies According to Natasha Scott</h1>

<h2>My Favorite Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>I consider this to be the best love movie of all time. It is also my favorite movie overall.</p>

<h3>300</h3>
<p>I usually don't like period movies, but 300 is full of action. There are numerous fight scenes that I consider to be iconic.</p>

<h3>Think Like a Man</h3>
<p>I wanted to add a comedy to this list. This is one my favorite comedy/ romance movies.</p>
